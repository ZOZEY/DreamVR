# DreamVR

DreamVR is modification for game VRChat. It is created with purpose of improving user experience immensely without impacting negatively other players. Main focus of Dream is to let you enjoy the game while fitting as if it was part of the game itself.

**NOTE:** Whenever VRChat manages to push infamous Unity 2018 update and it's not possible to continue with project I'll put source code here.
